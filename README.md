# Virtual-assistant

Welcome to the Virtual Assistant project! This virtual assistant is built on a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based model using the Naive Bayes Algorithm. It provides users with a robust and efficient way to interact with the assistant via an API.

## Features
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): The virtual assistant leverages NLP to understand and process user inputs.
- Naive Bayes Algorithm: A powerful and straightforward probabilistic classifier that forms the backbone of the virtual assistant's decision-making process.
- API Access: Users can interact with the virtual assistant through a well-documented API, allowing for seamless integration into other applications.

# Technology Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Machine Learning Algorithm: Naive Bayes
Libraries:
- nltk for natural language processing
- sklearn for implementing the Naive Bayes classifier
- flask for creating the API
